# Bank Marketing Prediction

**This work has been done as a partial fulfillment of the course Machine Learning (ML) Applications for Business during Fall 2022 at IIT Jodhpur.**

### Dataset

I have used the Bank Marketing Dataset from UCI ML Repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). The details about the dataset can be found in the given link.

### Notebook

Contains snippets of EDA and classification algorithms. The EDA plots can be found in [Plots]() folder.

The classification algorithms have been trained using different settings of hyperparameters and the best models for each of the classifiers have been retained. Classification algorithms used -
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Finally, for each of the classifiers, **Importance of Features** have been shown. This may vary for every classifier as they have different ways of interpreting them.
